# Transfer Learning Based Intrusion Detection System Using Fiber Speckle Patterns under Dynamic Environmental Conditions

Browser‚Äëbased "transfer learning" demo that classifies "intrusion vs. normal" from multimode‚Äëfiber (MMF) speckle patterns captured by a webcam/camera.  
A frozen "MobileNetV3" backbone provides feature vectors, and a lightweight trainable head is (re)trained *on device with a few new samples to adapt to environmental drift (temperature, pressure/contact, and source‚Äëcurrent variations). Implemented in **TensorFlow.js** and runs on Chrome/Chromium/Edge with optional WebGL acceleration.

## ‚ú® Highlights

- **On‚Äëdevice training & inference** (no server GPU required): runs entirely in the browser (TF.js), WebGL if available, CPU fallback otherwise.
- **Transfer learning**: ImageNet‚Äëpretrained MobileNetV3 is **frozen**; only a small 2‚Äëclass head is trained.
- **Few‚Äëshot micro‚Äëupdates**: collect a handful of boundary samples and trigger a quick head‚Äëonly retrain to keep up with slow environmental drift.
- **Thresholded alerting**: shows an on‚Äëscreen **INTRUSION** overlay when the intrusion probability exceeds the threshold.
- **RPi 5 & PC**: works on Raspberry Pi 5 (Chromium) and desktop PCs; performance depends on camera resolution and hardware acceleration.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 0) Prerequisites
- **Node.js 18+**
- **Chrome / Chromium / Edge** (allow camera access)
- A webcam (USB or built‚Äëin)

> Browser security requires a **secure context**. `http://localhost` is considered secure for `getUserMedia`, so please run the local server rather than opening files directly.

### 1) Clone & install
```bash
git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL> Intrusion_detection
cd Intrusion_detection

# If you do not already have a package.json:
npm init -y
npm i express
```

### 2) Run
```bash
node app.js
# open http://localhost:3000
```

### 3) Use the app
1. Open `http://localhost:3000` and **allow the camera** when prompted.
2. Click **Enable Webcam** to start the live preview.
3. Collect training images with **Gather Normal** and **Gather Intrusion**.
4. Click **Train & Predict!** to train the head and start real‚Äëtime inference.
5. When the **intrusion probability** exceeds the threshold, the UI shows an **INTRUSION** overlay.

> Tip: Start with a balanced set of Normal and Intrusion images from your deployment environment (lighting/temperature/contact conditions). Then let the **few‚Äëshot updates** refine performance on borderline cases.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Parameters (see `public/script.js`)

```js
// Intrusion alert threshold (default: 0.70)
const INTRUSION_THRESHOLD = 0.70;

// "Low‚Äëconfidence Normal" band upper limit (default: 0.85)
const CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.85;

// Number of samples to gather before a micro‚Äëretrain (default: 5)
const RELEARN_BATCH = 5;
```

**Optional (boundary‚Äëfocused updates).** If you prefer collecting only borderline Normal samples, limit auto‚Äëcollection to a band such as `0.75 ‚â§ p_normal < 0.85` by modifying the condition that queues Normal samples for retraining, e.g.:

```js
if (inferenceStarted && hi === CLASS1_INDEX &&
    prob[CLASS1_INDEX] >= 0.75 && prob[CLASS1_INDEX] < CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD) {
  // enqueue feature for boundary-focused few-shot update
}
```

This focuses adaptation on **hard/near‚Äëmiss** samples close to the decision boundary, which is typically more effective against slow drift.

## üß† Model Sketch

- **Backbone**: MobileNetV3 (frozen, feature vectors at 224√ó224 input)
- **Head**: Dense(1024‚Üí128, ReLU) ‚Üí Dense(128‚Üí2, Softmax)
- **Loss/Opt**: standard cross‚Äëentropy with an adaptive optimizer (TF.js)
- **Training**: quick head‚Äëonly (re)training in a Web Worker (`trainer.js`) to keep the UI responsive
